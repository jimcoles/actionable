 * <p>This package defines a model by which other conceptual models can be described.  This model
 * is very similar to UML core.
 * <p>The primary intended usage of these objects is to support dynamic data modeling
 * within an application.  E.g., the creation of custom attributes within an issue
 * tracking system.
 * <p>These classes might turn into Java AOP @tags or optionally be accessible as tags.</p>
